Preheat oven to 150 C / Gas 2. Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. Draw a 23cm 
circle on the paper. An easy way to do this is to draw around the outside of a cake 
tin with a pencil.

In a large bowl, beat egg whites on high speed until soft peaks form. Add 150g of the 
sugar gradually, while continuing to whip. Make sure sugar is completely dissolved. 
Mix together the remaining sugar with the cornflour; lightly fold into meringue with 
lemon juice.

Spread a layer of meringue to fit circle on parchment, approximately 1/2 cm thick. 
Pipe or spoon the remaining meringue in swirls around the edges to form a shallow 
bowl shape.

Bake at 150 C / Gas 2 for 1 hour. Turn off oven, but leave meringue in oven for an 
additional 30 minutes. When cool, the meringue should be hard on the outside, and 
slightly moist on the inside.

In a large bowl, combine the cream and icing sugar (optional) and whip until thick. 
Decorate with fruit of your choice; strawberries are excellent.
